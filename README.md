# Business Challenge: EDA and SQL

## Introduction

A data project lifecycle has many phases, rather than being just an isolated analysis in a single tool.
In this project you will experience doing an analysis using both Python and SQL to obtain the final result, by exploring each tool's behavior.

## Project Overview

Pick up a dataset in our common datasets repos and break your work into big steps:
 1. Pick a topic and choose a dataset on that topic. Build around 10 Business questions to answer about this topic.
 	- Try to build the questions before knowing everything about the data
 	- If not possible, do step 2. first
 2. Data Analysis: Understand your dataset and create a report (word document) about it
 3. Data Exploration and Business Understanding: 
 	- Import your dataset into SQL
 	- Answer your Business questions with SQL Queries


## Dataset repos

 - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
 - [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)
 - [PorData](https://www.pordata.pt/)
 - [And many more](https://medium.com/@LearnPythonProgramming/best-data-sources-for-datasets-beyond-kaggle-98aac51e971e)


## Bonus

 - Bonus points if you augment your data with data your obtain through WebScrapping
 - Bonus points if you include visualizations from Python and/or Tableau in the final presentation

## Deliverables

1. **Python Code:** Provide well-documented Python code that conducts the analysis and SQL upload.
2. **SQL text file (.sql)** well commented document with all the queries answering the Business questions
3. **Short Presentation:** Structure the presentation in the following way:
 - Intro Slides: introduce the problem and the datasets
 - Data cleaning and assumptions
 - Business questions and SQL query (1 slide per question with a print screen of the query and the answer is enough)
4. **PDF Document** with notes you might want to share
